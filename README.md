# ECE555 Final Project - IoT Farming Sensor Platform

## Abstract
Recent advancements in technology can help farmers make insightful, data-driven decisions based on environmental conditions. Accurate real-time data can determine where to plant crops, how much water to irrigate, and how to best protect plants from pests and diseases. As a result, farmers can improve their efficiency, productivity, and sustainability while conserving valuable resources.
In this project, we aim to build a farm monitoring station capable of measuring soil moisture, ambient temperature, humidity, and lighting and sending the recorded information to a cloud server. Users should be able to monitor the measurements on a live web-based dashboard.
Problem Statement
